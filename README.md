## v2
Added ambitions variables again. Also, added GPD var to full model (it was collinear). However, it is not included in the selected model, so no issue.

Added S_GPD and also make two analyses with removed outlier.

## V5

Changed IV and DVs

## V6

- Larger sample again (fixed in data). 
- Removed renv
- collinearity test only for selected models
- Restructured

## v7
- added possibility to make custom models that are informed by stepwise selection, but with theorethic adjustments

## v9
- log-transformation of single predictor to make more stable
